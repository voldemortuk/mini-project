# X-ray Abnormality detection model
## Introduction 
The Machine learning model was developed in Python programming lan- guage using Pytorch and implemented in JavaScript. 
The UI was created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. ChexNet is a deep learning algorithm that can detect and localize 14 kinds of diseases from chest X-ray images. 
Here we have implemented the [CheXNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/) using Python3 (Pytorch) and used Flask to integrate with our web-app.
Our Web-app also detects COVID-19 using X-ray images for which we used the [COVID-19 chest xray](https://www.kaggle.com/bachrr/covid-chest-xray) dataset on different ML models.



## Dataset

The [ChestX-ray14 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/datae) comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with 14 disease labels. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and its dependencies
- Flask 2.0.1

## Usage

1. Download images of ChestX-ray14 from this [released page](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) and decompress them to the directory [images](./ChestX-ray14/images).

2. Download this [colab notebook](https://github.com/ravijyoti3/mini-project/blob/main/web_mini_project.ipynb) and run locally

##Result
ChexNet outputs a vector t of binary labels indicating the ab- sence or presence of each of the following 14 pathology classes: Atelec- tasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nod-ule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, and Pneumotho- rax. 

### Model Output 
![ModelOutpu](https://github.com/ravijyoti3/mini-project/blob/main/Images/Model%20output.png)
We have implemented it using py- torch and replaced the final fully connected layer in CheXNet with a fully connected layer producing a 15-dimensional output, after which we apply an elementwise sigmoid nonlinearity. The final output is the predicted probability of the presence of each pathology class.

## Conclusion 

The main objective of the project was to build a Web-app inte- grated with our ML model is to detect and localise different diseases through X-ray images.
Also in recent times COVID-19 virus has spread primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette. So our final web-app also will detect if the input X-ray image has symptoms or COVID-19 or not.
In conclusion this algorithm can and should save lives in many parts of the world by assisting medical staff which lacks skilled radi- ologists or assist radiologists directly.
