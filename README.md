# X-ray Abnormality detection model
## Introduction 

The Machine learning model was developed in Python programming lan- guage using Pytorch and implemented in JavaScript. The UI was created us- ing HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Dataset

The [ChestX-ray14 dataset](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with 14 disease labels. To evaluate the model, we randomly split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%) and test (20%) sets, following the work in paper. Partitioned image names and corresponding labels are placed under the directory [labels](./ChestX-ray14/labels).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and its dependencies
- Flask 2.0.1

##Result
ChexNet outputs a vector t of binary labels indicating the ab- sence or presence of each of the following 14 pathology classes: Atelec- tasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nod-ule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, and Pneumotho- rax. 

### Model Output 
![ModelOutpu](https://github.com/ravijyoti3/mini-project/blob/main/Images/Model%20output.png)
We have implemented it using py- torch and replaced the final fully connected layer in CheXNet with a fully connected layer producing a 15-dimensional output, after which we apply an elementwise sigmoid nonlinearity. The final output is the predicted probability of the presence of each pathology class.

## Conclusion 

The main objective of the project was to build a Web-app inte- grated with our ML model is to detect and localise different diseases through X-ray images.
Also in recent times COVID-19 virus has spread primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette. So our final web-app also will detect if the input X-ray image has symptoms or COVID-19 or not.
In conclusion this algorithm can and should save lives in many parts of the world by assisting medical staff which lacks skilled radi- ologists or assist radiologists directly.
